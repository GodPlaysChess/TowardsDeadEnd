  Some thoughts about the algorithm:
  Best solution for N-word sequence is the Best solution for N-1 word sequence +
    1) if it is still fit on the last line - then put it there
    2) if it does not fit, then we rearrange the words somehow
      so we have to put them on the new line (n), and may be shift a word from (n - 2) -> (n - 1)

      AS an example consider          (length is 10)
      3 3 4
      5
      7 2

      When 7 is added and does not fit, we must shift 4 to the next line.
      Essentially it happens, because nth line becomes n-1th line, and suddenly begins to add a score
